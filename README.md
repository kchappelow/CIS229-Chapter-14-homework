## Text Analysis

String manipulation enables interesting approaches to analyzing the writings of great authors. 
Much attention has been focused on whether William Shakespeare ever lived. Some scholars believe thereâ€™s substantial evidence indicating that Christopher Marlowe actually penned the masterpieces attributed to Shakespeare. 
Researchers have used computers to find similarities in the writings of these two authors. 
This exercise examines two methods for analyzing texts with a computer.

1. Write an application that reads a line of text from the keyboard and prints a table indicating the number of occurrences of each letter of the alphabet in the text. For example, the phrase

```
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
```

contains one "a," two "b's," no "c's," and so on.

2. Write an application that reads a line of text and prints a table indicating the number of one-letter words, two-letter words, three-letter words, and so on, appearing in the text. For example, Fig. 14.25 shows the counts for the phrase

```
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
```

| Word Length | Occurrences        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 1           | 0                  |
| 2           | 2                  |
| 3           | 1                  |
| 4           | 2 (including 'tis) |
| 5           | 0                  |
| 6           | 2                  |
| 7           | 1                  |
